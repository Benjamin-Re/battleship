TODO
- instead of hardcoding the grid to 5x5 make it scalable
- add some css the form
- add a visual indication on whos turn it is
- add a visual indication on who won
- add a ship themed background
- add sounds
- instead of having players enter the coordinates to place their ships offer a drag and drop mechanism
- set ship sizes to fixed length. Random distribution is very uneven. Ships of size one are possible. Each player should get the same sized ships.
